After finishing his previous work, Rave Master, 
Hiro Mashima found the story sentimental and sad at the same time,
so he wanted the storyline of Fairy Tail to have 
a "lot of fun [for everyone]". When originally 
creating the series, Mashima was inspired by
magicians and wizards. He based Natsu's motion 
sickness on one of his friends, who gets sick when 
taking taxis together.[10] When naming Natsu, Mashima 
thought western fantasy names would be unfamiliar 
to Japanese audiences. When writing individual chapters of
Fairy Tail, Mashima takes a five-day process: on Monday, the script 
and storyboards are written. On Tuesday, Mashima writes rough sketches. 
From Wednesday to Friday, he finishes the drawing and inking on the chapters. 
Mashima usually begins new chapters after completing the previous ones.
For the characters of the series, Mashima drew upon people he has known in his life.
In establishing the father-son relationship between Natsu and Igneel,
Mashima cited his father's death when he was a child as an influence. 
Mashima based the humorous aspects 
of the series on his daily life and jokes his assistants would make.
